# b

It can be solved by declare the pointer as a non-constant pointer.
# c

It uses for-each statement. However, input of this function requires a
explicit length.

It can be solved by using std::vector as function input.


# d

be altered.

# e

The type of ptr is int, but it is assigned as a double value at
line 5. It can be solved by declaring:

double *ptr = &d;
