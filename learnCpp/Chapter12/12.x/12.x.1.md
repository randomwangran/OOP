# a
getName() is a constant function. Can not assign a variable to a
reference.

======
wrong. getName() is not a virtual function.

# b

getName() in the derived class is a constant type, which is not
consistent with its base class.
# c

object slice. A derived object was assign to its base part. Only the
base part will be copied.

# d
It is ok.

=====
Wrong. Base is marked as final meaning the overriding function will
not be utilized in its derived class.

# e

The virtual function declaration is wrong, it should be declared in
the base class not the derived class.

# f 

The pointer d is never been deleted.
