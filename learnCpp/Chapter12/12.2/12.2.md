#a
C
===
Wrong. Did you see that there is no getName() function here!

#b
B
===
Wrong.

=> I do not understand.

rBase is in the scope of B. Its definition is B &rBase.

When the call (rBase.getName) is executed, I thought the relation is
between the base class(A) and the class B, so I gave a solution of B,
which is wrong.

However, "the most derived matching call" is between classes B and C,
which I do not understand.

#c
A

#d
A
====
Wrong. Implicit virtual function?


#e
A

#f
Not compile.

Wrong.
