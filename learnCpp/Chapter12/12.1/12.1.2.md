The programmer will encounter the difficult in constructing the
derived classes. For example, one wants to add a private member in the
Cat class:

[code]
class Cat : public Animal
{
	std::string m_birthPlace;
public:
	Cat(std::string name, std::string birthPlace)
		: Animal(name, "Meow")
	{
	}

	const char* speak() { return "Meow"; }
	std::string getBirthPlace() { return m_birthPlace; }
};
[/code]

If you construct the Cat instance like the following code:

[code]
Cat fred("Fred","TaiWan"), misty("Misty","Jinan"), zeke("Zeke", "Shaanxi");
[/code]

Then the code will not work as you expected. You will have hard time
in constructing a private member in the Cat class.
