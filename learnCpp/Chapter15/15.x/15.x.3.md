#a

Because ptr1 and ptr2 share the same Resource, the second one should
copy from the first one. Otherwise, two shared ptrs do not know the
existence of the other.

#b

If an exception is throw for one of the constructor, the other one
will not be de-allowcated properly because shared_ptr will only be
deleted where all the pointers are properly deleted.
