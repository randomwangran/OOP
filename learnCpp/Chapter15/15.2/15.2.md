The following line will not compile:

C, G.

=====

A normal reference could not be assigned to a r-value type of data, so
B will not be compile. The exception is that a normal reference is
defined as a constant variable.


A r-reference is only able to be assigned to "r-value" type of data,
so E and G will not be compile.
