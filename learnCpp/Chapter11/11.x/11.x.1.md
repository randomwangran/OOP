#a
It will output:


Base()
Derived()
~Derived()
~Base()

#b

Base()
Derived()
~Derived()
~Base()
Base()
~Base()

=======
Wrong. In the main program, there is only one block, so each of the
item will be generated first. When they are out of the scope, the
desturctor will be called.

#c

It won't compiler becasue it has two print functions sharing the same
name in both drived and base class.

======
The reason is not correct. In the derived class, there is no member
variables called m_x, so the complier will go back to its base class,
to check the existance of m_x. However, m_x in the base class is
private, it can not be access outside of the class.

#d

Base()
Derived()
Base: 5
~Derived()
~Base()

=====
Third line wrong. When a object of a class try to call a function, it
will first try to find nearby.

#e

Base()
Derived()
D2()
Derived: 5
~D2()
~Derived()
~Base()
