Aggregation. Animial has type and name.

Wrong. If something is only use for a particular thing, then it is
composition.

## b
Association. Test editor use a save() function to save a file.

Wrong...
This is not a use relation?

## c
Aggregation. An adventure has a kind of item.

## d
Dependency. It is similar to the function std::cout.

Wrong. 
Why wrong? In this case, the Program is similar to a normal function;
A Computer can be viewed as a function (similar to std::cout). So,
the relation could be described as Dependency?

## e
Composition. A CPU can only belong to a computer at once.

Wrong.

If something is not dependent on something, then it could be a
composition relation. For example, a bag of marble.
