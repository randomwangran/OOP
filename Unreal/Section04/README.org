** result
   
   [[file:Source/screenCapture/tankBodyOutPutCorrectAimingLocation.png]]

** notes in lecture

** question that I do not understand
*** crash
    
    When I try to get the owner of the 'aiming component', the UE
    crush without any info.

** a-ha moment
*** pointer to pointer

    This is the first time that I use it intentionlly in real
    programming, and it is in this lesson, that I've learnt that it is
    useful when you want to separate a function in a class.

    I've stuck in this issue for a long time. At first, I think I
    should write another getter to return a 'UTankAimingComponent' so
    that the tank can use AimAt method defined in
    'UTankAimingComponent' class.

    #+BEGIN_SRC 
    UTankAimingComponent* ATankAIController::GetAimingComponent() const
    {
	return Cast<UTankAimingComponent>(GetPawn());
    }
    #+END_SRC
