*** basic
**** linear memory and linear address
     I am not sure the correct jargon here. Linear memory is just
     another way to manage memory? For the "physical memory", the
     adress of it is this: 1,2,3,4,5,6,...
     
     For the "linear memory", we say memoery adress is like this:
     1,3,5,7,9...

     The first element of both "physical" and "linear memory" is 1,
     but the second is different. "Physical" memory is 2, whereas
     "linear" memory is 3.

     I am correct?
